# dotfiles
scuffed dotfiles and various kernel stuff.

some of the dots are configured properly, some aren't. it works for me though, hence "scuffed". while this configuration works for my workflow, it might not work for you. so please check the dots first if you decide to use it. please don't use this configuration as a base for your own configs, you'll cry.

to be used with bspwm + sxhkd + polybar + dunst setup, i've also configured a bit of awesome but lua is kind of a pain in the ass. dwm configuration soon, it's still ugly for now and the workflow is not quite there yet. the rofi theme isn't mine, so go find it elsewhere.

the wallpaper is edited with image go nord.
